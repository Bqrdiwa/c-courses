#Let's begin with the basics: What is a Macro? 🤔
}
{{
#What is a Macro?
{
##Definition and Usage
###A macro is a preprocessor directive in C++ that allows you to define a block of code that gets replaced by a specified value or expression before compilation. 
###It simplifies code maintenance and reduces redundancy.
}
{
#Example of a simple macro:
^^^
#define PI 3.14159
std::cout << PI; // Output: 3.14159
^^^
###In this example, the macro `PI` is replaced with `3.14159` during preprocessing, so when we print `PI`, it outputs the value `3.14159`.
}
}
{
#Now, let's explore how to define macros. ✏️
}
{{
#Defining Macros
{
##Definition and Usage
###Macros are defined using the `#define` directive followed by the macro name and its replacement value.
###For example:
}
{
#Example of defining a macro:
^^^
#define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
std::cout << MAX(10, 20); // Output: 20
^^^
###Here, the macro `MAX(a, b)` compares two values and returns the larger one. The values `10` and `20` are passed in, and the macro evaluates the maximum.
}

#Let's look at using macros in conditional compilation 🔧
}
{{
#Using Macros
{
##Definition and Usage
###Macros can also be used to include or exclude certain sections of code based on conditions. This is useful for debugging or platform-specific code.
}
{
#Example of conditional compilation:
^^^
#define DEBUG
#ifdef DEBUG
    std::cout << "Debugging enabled!" << std::endl;
#endif
^^^
###In this example, the message "Debugging enabled!" will be printed only if the `DEBUG` macro is defined.
}
}
{
#Next, let's talk about the advantages of using macros. 🚀
}
{{
#Advantages of Macros
{
##Why use Macros?
###- **Code Reusability:** Macros help you avoid writing the same code repeatedly.
###- **Improved Readability:** Macros can make your code easier to read by abstracting complex expressions.
###- **Conditional Compilation:** Macros are great for compiling code conditionally, such as enabling or disabling debugging features.

#Now, let's explore some predefined macros in C++ 📚
}
{{
#Predefined Macros
{
##Definition and Usage
###C++ provides several predefined macros that give information about the compilation environment, such as file name, line number, etc.
###For example:
}
{
#Example of predefined macros:
^^^
std::cout << __FILE__ << " at line " << __LINE__ << std::endl;
^^^
###The `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` macros give you the current file name and line number, respectively. This is useful for debugging.
